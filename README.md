# **Object-Oriented Programming with CPP**
---

### **DESCRIPTION**
---

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a superset of object based programming. It offers all the features of object-based and overcomes
its limitation by implementing inheritance. It views a problem in terms of objects involved rather than procedure for doing it. It represents an entity that can store data & has its interface through functions.

## **FEATURES**
---

The various concepts involved are class, object, dynamic binding and message passing.
The four pillars are Data abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance & Polymorphism.
Go through the programs of this repository to make a clear vision of the topics mentioned.
We've tried to make the programs & have added the description explaining the respective topics.
Notes of all topics are added with the program for a quick reference.
In this repository, we've tried to cover the following topics:
- Class & object
- Constructor
- Destructor
- Friend class & Friend function
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## **OOP MINDMAPS**
---

Mindmaps are the best way to understand the topic quickly. Thus, we;vve tried to make our own mindmaps.
There are mindmaps below in which OOP is explained for skimming.
Either go through them here or click on the image to download it as a pdf.
